# Information about regulation section: 1904.39
29 CFR 1904.39 - Reporting Fatalities, Hospitalizations, Amputations, and Losses of an Eye

## Authority
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)

## Category
Reporting Requirements (Immediate Notification)

## Purpose
Requires employers to report severe work-related injuries to OSHA within specified timeframes. This is SEPARATE from recordkeeping - even exempt employers must report these events.

## Key Requirements
- Report fatalities within **8 hours**
- Report in-patient hospitalizations within **24 hours**
- Report amputations within **24 hours**
- Report losses of an eye within **24 hours**
- ALL employers must report, regardless of size or industry exemption
- Report by phone, in person, or via online portal

## Technical Specs

### Reporting Timeframes

| Event | Timeframe | Clock Starts |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| **Fatality** | **8 hours** | When employer learns of death |
| **In-patient hospitalization** | **24 hours** | When employer learns of hospitalization |
| **Amputation** | **24 hours** | When employer learns of amputation |
| **Loss of an eye** | **24 hours** | When employer learns of loss |

### What Triggers Reporting

**Fatality:**
- Any work-related death
- Death must occur within **30 days** of the work-related incident
- Includes deaths from heart attacks if work-related

**In-Patient Hospitalization:**
- Formal admission to the in-patient service of a hospital or clinic
- Does NOT include: ER visits, outpatient surgery, observation stays, urgent care
- Must be for treatment, not just observation/testing

**Amputation:**
- Traumatic loss of a limb or body part
- Includes: finger, toe, arm, leg, or any body part
- Includes fingertip amputations with bone loss
- Does NOT include: avulsions, degloving, amputations of just skin/soft tissue

**Loss of an Eye:**
- Complete loss of the eye
- Includes enucleation (surgical removal)
- Does NOT include: loss of vision while eye remains intact

### How to Report

**Option 1: Phone**
- Call nearest OSHA Area Office during business hours
- Call OSHA 24-hour hotline: **1-800-321-OSHA (1-800-321-6742)**

**Option 2: Online**
- Submit via OSHA's online reporting portal
- www.osha.gov/report

**Option 3: In Person**
- Report in person at nearest OSHA Area Office

### Information Required in Report

You must provide:
- Establishment name
- Location of incident
- Time of incident
- Type of event (fatality, hospitalization, amputation, loss of eye)
- Number of employees affected
- Names of employees affected
- Contact person and phone number
- Brief description of incident

### Who Must Report

**ALL employers must report these events, including:**
- Employers normally exempt from OSHA recordkeeping (small employers, low-hazard industries)
- Employers with no other recordable injuries
- Employers covered by State Plans (report to State Plan, not Federal OSHA)

### Exceptions to Reporting

You do NOT need to report if the event resulted from:
- Motor vehicle accident on a public street/highway (except in construction work zone)
- Commercial airplane, train, subway, or bus accident
- Hospitalization for diagnostic testing or observation only

**Fatality exception:**
- Do not report if death occurs more than 30 days after the incident
- Heart attack deaths are reportable if work-related and within 30 days

### Timeline Clarifications

| Scenario | Reportable? | Timeframe |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Employee dies at scene | Yes | 8 hours from learning of death |
| Employee dies in hospital 5 days later | Yes | 8 hours from learning of death |
| Employee dies 45 days after incident | No | Beyond 30-day window |
| Employee hospitalized immediately | Yes | 24 hours from learning of hospitalization |
| Employee hospitalized 3 days after incident | Yes | 24 hours from learning (if within 24 hrs of incident) |
| Employee hospitalized 5 days after incident | No | Beyond 24-hour incident window |
| ER visit only, sent home | No | Not in-patient hospitalization |

### State Plan Considerations

If you're in a State Plan state, report to your **State OSHA**, not Federal OSHA:
- California (Cal/OSHA)
- Michigan (MIOSHA)
- Washington (L&I)
- And other State Plan states

Check OSHA's website for current State Plan list.

## Decision Flow

```
Did a work-related fatality occur?
├─ Yes, within 30 days of incident → REPORT WITHIN 8 HOURS
└─ No → Continue

Did work-related in-patient hospitalization occur?
├─ Yes, hospitalized within 24 hours of incident → REPORT WITHIN 24 HOURS
└─ No (ER only, observation, outpatient) → Continue

Did work-related amputation occur?
├─ Yes, within 24 hours of incident → REPORT WITHIN 24 HOURS
└─ No → Continue

Did work-related loss of an eye occur?
├─ Yes, within 24 hours of incident → REPORT WITHIN 24 HOURS
└─ No → No immediate reporting required

Note: Still record on Form 300 if recordable, even if no immediate report required.
```

## Common Misapplications

1. **Confusing reporting with recording**: Reporting (calling OSHA) is separate from recording (Form 300). You can have a reportable event that doesn't require a Form 300 entry, and vice versa.

2. **Thinking exempt employers don't report**: ALL employers must report severe injuries, regardless of size or industry exemption from recordkeeping.

3. **Counting ER visits as hospitalizations**: Emergency room treatment is NOT in-patient hospitalization. The employee must be formally admitted to the in-patient service.

4. **Missing the hospitalization time window**: Hospitalization must occur within 24 hours of the incident to be reportable. If employee is hospitalized 3 days after a back strain, it's not reportable (but may still be recordable).

5. **Not reporting fingertip amputations**: Fingertip amputations involving bone loss ARE amputations and must be reported within 24 hours.

6. **Starting the clock at incident time**: The reporting clock starts when the **employer learns** of the event, not when it occurred. If you learn of a death Monday morning that happened Sunday night, your 8 hours starts Monday morning.

7. **Reporting to wrong agency**: Employers in State Plan states must report to their State OSHA, not Federal OSHA. Know your jurisdiction.

8. **Not reporting heart attack deaths**: Work-related heart attack deaths are reportable fatalities if the death occurs within 30 days and the heart attack was work-related.

9. **Waiting to gather all details**: Report within the timeframe with whatever information you have. You can provide additional details later.

10. **Assuming motor vehicle accident exemption applies broadly**: The exemption only applies to accidents on public roads. Forklift accidents, accidents on private property, and construction zone accidents are still reportable.

## FAQ

1) **We're a small employer exempt from OSHA recordkeeping. Do we still report?**
   Yes. ALL employers must report fatalities within 8 hours and hospitalizations, amputations, and eye losses within 24 hours, regardless of exemption status.

2) **An employee went to the ER and was kept overnight for observation. Is that reportable?**
   Not if they were only held for observation or diagnostic testing. In-patient hospitalization means formal admission for treatment. Observation stays are typically outpatient status.

3) **Employee cut off fingertip but no bone was involved. Reportable?**
   If no bone was amputated (only soft tissue), it may not meet OSHA's definition of amputation for reporting purposes. However, it's likely still recordable as a significant injury.

4) **We're in California. Do we call Federal OSHA or Cal/OSHA?**
   Report to Cal/OSHA. California is a State Plan state. Always report to your State Plan agency if you're in a State Plan state.

5) **Employee was hospitalized 48 hours after the incident. Do we report?**
   No. The hospitalization must occur within 24 hours of the work-related incident to trigger the reporting requirement. However, the case may still be recordable on Form 300.
