29 CFR 1904.7(b)(3) - How to Count Days Away from Work

## Authority
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)

## Category
Recording Criteria - Days Away Calculation

## Purpose
Provides specific rules for counting days away from work when recording work-related injuries and illnesses. Proper counting is essential for accurate Form 300 entries and calculating injury rates (DART, DAFWII).

## Key Requirements
- Do NOT count the day of injury or illness onset
- Count calendar days, not scheduled work days
- Include weekends, holidays, and vacation days
- Cap the count at 180 days maximum
- Stop counting if employee leaves for unrelated reasons
- Begin counting the day after the injury/illness onset

## Technical Specs

### Basic Counting Rule (§1904.7(b)(3)(i))

**Start counting:** The day AFTER the injury or illness occurs
**What to count:** Calendar days the employee is unable to work
**Maximum count:** 180 days

### Day of Injury Rule (§1904.7(b)(3)(ii))

The day of the injury or onset of illness is NEVER counted as a day away from work, regardless of:
- What time of day the injury occurred
- Whether the employee worked any part of that day
- Whether the employee was sent home

**Example:**
- Employee injured Monday at 9 AM, sent home
- Day 1 of days away = Tuesday
- Monday is NOT counted

### Calendar Days Rule (§1904.7(b)(3)(iii)-(iv))

Count ALL calendar days, including:
- Weekdays (Monday-Friday)
- Weekends (Saturday-Sunday)
- Holidays
- Days the employee would not normally work
- Vacation days
- Personal days

**Example:**
- Employee injured Friday, cannot work Monday-Friday
- Count: Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday = **7 days**
- NOT 5 days (not just scheduled work days)

### The 180-Day Cap (§1904.7(b)(3)(v))

- Maximum days away to record: **180**
- If employee is still out after 180 days, enter 180 on Form 300
- Do NOT add more days even if employee remains out longer
- Check box for "Injury" or "Illness" column regardless of actual time out

### When to Stop Counting (§1904.7(b)(3)(vi))

Stop counting days away when any of these occur:
1. Employee returns to work (full duty)
2. Employee returns to restricted work
3. Employee reaches 180 days
4. Employee dies
5. Employee retires
6. Employee leaves employment for reasons unrelated to injury/illness
7. PLHCP determines employee can return to work

### Physician Restriction vs Employer Decision

| Scenario | Days Away? |
|----------|------------|
| Doctor says employee cannot work, employee stays home | Yes, count days |
| Doctor says employee CAN work, employer keeps them home | Not days away (employer decision) |
| Doctor says modified duty only, no modified duty available | Count as days away |
| Doctor gives no restrictions, employee chooses to stay home | Not days away |

### Intermittent Days Away

If employee is away intermittently (e.g., dialysis, ongoing treatment):
- Count each calendar day the employee cannot work due to the injury/illness
- Do not count days they work, even partial days
- Continue counting for same case up to 180-day cap

### Overlap with Restricted Work

If an employee has both days away AND restricted work days:
- Record days away in Column K
- Record restricted/transfer days in Column L
- Do NOT double-count: a day is either "away" or "restricted," not both
- Total of both columns cannot exceed 180 days for a single case

## Decision Flow

```
Day of injury → DO NOT COUNT THIS DAY
                    │
                    ▼
Next calendar day → START COUNTING (Day 1)
                    │
                    ▼
Each subsequent calendar day:
├─ Employee cannot work due to injury? → COUNT IT
├─ Weekend/Holiday? → COUNT IT (if still unable to work)
├─ Employee returns to work? → STOP COUNTING
├─ Employee returns to restricted duty? → STOP (switch to restricted days)
├─ Reached 180 days? → STOP (record 180)
└─ Employee leaves employment (unrelated)? → STOP COUNTING
```

## Common Misapplications

1. **Counting the day of injury**: The most common error. The day of injury is NEVER counted, even if the employee went home immediately after the incident.

2. **Counting only scheduled work days**: Days away means CALENDAR days, not scheduled work days. Weekend days count. Holiday days count. This is the second most common error.

3. **Stopping at scheduled return date**: If a doctor clears an employee to return on Monday but they don't actually return until Wednesday, you only count through Sunday. Days they choose not to work when cleared are not days away.

4. **Exceeding 180 days**: Never record more than 180 days, even if employee is out for a year. The cap is firm.

5. **Resetting count for same injury**: If an employee returns and then goes back out for the same injury, continue the original count (don't restart). It's still the same case.

6. **Counting employer-initiated time off**: If the employer sends an employee home but the doctor has cleared them to work, these are NOT days away from work. Days away requires medical inability to work.

7. **Part-time employee calculation**: Count calendar days even for part-time employees. If a part-time employee (works Mon/Wed/Fri) is injured and out for a week, count all 7 calendar days, not 3 work days.

8. **Missing intermittent days**: For ongoing treatments (dialysis, physical therapy), each day the employee cannot work due to the injury counts - even if months apart.

9. **Vacation day during injury**: If an employee was already on approved vacation when injured and would have taken those days anyway, they do not count as days away. But if the injury prevented return from vacation, subsequent days count.

10. **Double-counting days away and restricted**: A single day is either a day away OR a restricted day, never both. Once an employee returns to restricted duty, stop counting days away.

## FAQ

1) **Do weekends count as days away from work?**
   Yes. Count all calendar days the employee is unable to work, including weekends, holidays, and any other days they would not normally work.

2) **What if the employee is injured on Friday and returns Monday?**
   Count Saturday and Sunday if the employee was unable to work due to the injury. Days away = 2 (Saturday and Sunday). Friday (day of injury) is not counted.

3) **The doctor cleared the employee to return but they didn't come back. Do those days count?**
   No. Once a physician clears an employee to return to work, the days away count stops. Employee choice to stay home is not days away from work.

4) **Our employee has been out for over a year. What do we record?**
   Record 180 days. That is the maximum, regardless of actual time away. Check the appropriate column and enter 180.

5) **Employee returns to restricted duty after 10 days. What do I record?**
   Record 10 days in the Days Away column (K) and then begin counting restricted days in column (L). The total across both columns for this case should not exceed 180.
