## Decision Flow

```
Does your establishment have 250+ employees?
├─ Yes → Submit 300A + 300 + 301 data by March 2
└─ No → Continue

Does your establishment have 20-249 employees?
├─ Yes → Check if NAICS code is on high-hazard list
│        ├─ Yes → Submit 300A data only by March 2
│        └─ No → No electronic submission required
└─ No (under 20) → No electronic submission required

Are you exempt from recordkeeping under §1904.1 or §1904.2?
├─ Yes → No electronic submission required
└─ No → Follow size/industry rules above
```

## Common Misapplications

1. **Confusing establishment vs company size**: The 250 and 20-249 thresholds are per ESTABLISHMENT (single location), not total company size. A company with 500 employees across 5 locations of 100 each would have no establishments meeting the 250 threshold.

2. **Missing the March 2 deadline**: The deadline is March 2, not March 31 or April 30 (those are Form 300A posting dates). Electronic submission has its own earlier deadline.

3. **Assuming all employers must submit**: Only establishments meeting size AND industry criteria must submit. Most small businesses are not covered.

4. **Submitting paper forms**: Electronic submission means via the ITA online portal. You cannot mail forms to satisfy this requirement.

5. **Not updating for employee count changes**: If your establishment crosses the 20 or 250 threshold, your submission requirements change. Reassess annually.

6. **Forgetting the 300A-only rule for mid-size**: Establishments with 20-249 employees in high-hazard industries only submit Form 300A data, NOT Forms 300 and 301.

7. **Ignoring State Plan requirements**: Some State Plan states have different or additional electronic reporting requirements. Check your state's requirements.

8. **Not accounting for NAICS code changes**: If your NAICS code changed, verify whether you're on the current high-hazard industry list.

9. **Assuming exempt industries never submit**: An exempt industry establishment with 250+ employees may still need to submit if they're required to keep records for other reasons.

10. **Thinking ITA submission replaces Form 300A posting**: Electronic submission to OSHA is separate from the requirement to physically post Form 300A at your workplace. You must do both.

## FAQ

1) **We have 200 employees. Do we submit electronically?**
   Only if your NAICS code is on the high-hazard industry list in Appendix A to Subpart E. If so, submit Form 300A data only. If not on the list, no electronic submission is required.

2) **We have 300 employees but are in a low-hazard industry. Do we submit?**
   Yes. All establishments with 250+ employees must submit, regardless of industry, as long as they are required to keep OSHA records.

3) **Is the March 2 deadline the same as the April 30 posting deadline?**
   No. These are separate requirements. Electronic submission to OSHA is due March 2. Physical posting of Form 300A at your workplace runs February 1 through April 30. You must comply with both.

4) **Can I submit a paper copy of Form 300A instead of using the online portal?**
   No. The regulation requires electronic submission via the ITA portal. Paper submissions do not satisfy this requirement.

5) **Our company has 1,000 employees across 10 locations of 100 each. Do we submit?**
   Evaluate each establishment separately. No single establishment has 250+ employees. Check if each location's NAICS code is on the high-hazard list for the 20-249 tier. If not, no electronic submission is required.
