# Information about regulation section: 1904.7
29 CFR 1904.7 - General recording criteria

## Authority
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)

## Category
Recording Criteria

## Purpose
Defines when a work-related injury or illness must be recorded on OSHA Forms 300, 300A, and 301. This is the core regulation that determines recordability for most workplace incidents.

## Key Requirements
- Record work-related injuries and illnesses that meet one or more general recording criteria
- Death must always be recorded
- Days away from work must be recorded
- Restricted work or job transfer must be recorded
- Medical treatment beyond first aid must be recorded
- Loss of consciousness must be recorded
- Significant injury or illness diagnosed by a physician or licensed health care professional must be recorded
- Certain specific conditions must always be recorded regardless of treatment (needlesticks, hearing loss, tuberculosis)

## Technical Specs

### General Recording Triggers (§1904.7(a))
An injury or illness is recordable if it results in any of the following:

| Criterion | Description | Recording Required |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Death | Fatality from work-related injury/illness | Always |
| Days away from work | Employee unable to work beyond day of injury | Yes, if any days |
| Restricted work | Employee cannot perform routine job functions | Yes |
| Job transfer | Employee transferred to another job | Yes |
| Medical treatment | Treatment beyond first aid | Yes |
| Loss of consciousness | Any duration | Always |
| Significant diagnosis | Diagnosed by PLHCP as significant | Yes |

### First Aid Treatments (NOT Recordable by Themselves)
Per §1904.7(a), the following are considered first aid and do NOT trigger recording:

- Using non-prescription medications at non-prescription strength
- Administering tetanus immunizations
- Cleaning, flushing, or soaking wounds on the surface of the skin
- Using wound coverings such as bandages, Band-Aids, gauze pads, or butterfly bandages/Steri-Strips
- Using hot or cold therapy
- Using any non-rigid means of support (elastic bandages, wraps, non-rigid back belts)
- Using temporary immobilization devices while transporting (splints, slings, neck collars, back boards)
- Drilling of fingernail or toenail to relieve pressure, or draining fluid from a blister
- Using eye patches
- Removing foreign bodies from the eye using only irrigation or a cotton swab
- Removing splinters or foreign material from areas other than the eye by irrigation, tweezers, cotton swabs, or other simple means
- Using finger guards
- Using massages (physical therapy or chiropractic treatment is medical treatment)
- Drinking fluids for relief of heat stress

### Medical Treatment (IS Recordable)
The following constitute medical treatment beyond first aid:

- Administering prescription medications (except first dose for observation)
- Administering non-prescription medications at prescription strength
- Using wound closing devices such as sutures, staples, or surgical glue
- Using rigid means of support (casts, splints that immobilize)
- Physical therapy or chiropractic treatment
- Removing foreign bodies from wounds if procedure is complicated
- Cutting away dead skin (surgical debridement)
- Application of any device with rigid stays designed to immobilize body parts

### Days Away from Work (§1904.7(b)(3))
- Do NOT count the day of injury or illness onset
- Count all calendar days (including weekends, holidays, days employee wouldn't normally work)
- Stop counting at 180 days maximum
- Stop counting if employee leaves employment for reasons unrelated to injury/illness

### Restricted Work (§1904.7(b)(4))
Restricted work occurs when an employer:
- Keeps the employee from performing one or more routine job functions
- Keeps the employee from working the full workday they would otherwise work

Routine functions are work activities regularly performed at least once per week.

## Decision Flow

```
Step 1: Is there a new case?
        ├─ No injury/illness → NOT RECORDABLE
        └─ Yes → Continue to Step 2

Step 2: Is it work-related? (See §1904.5)
        ├─ No → NOT RECORDABLE
        └─ Yes → Continue to Step 3

Step 3: Does it meet one or more general criteria?
        ├─ Death? → RECORDABLE
        ├─ Days away from work? → RECORDABLE
        ├─ Restricted work or job transfer? → RECORDABLE
        ├─ Medical treatment beyond first aid? → RECORDABLE
        ├─ Loss of consciousness? → RECORDABLE
        ├─ Significant diagnosis by PLHCP? → RECORDABLE
        └─ None of the above → NOT RECORDABLE
```

## Common Misapplications

1. **Recording first aid cases**: Bandages, ice packs, and OTC medications at OTC strength are first aid and do not trigger recording by themselves.

2. **Not recording prescription medications**: Any prescription medication (except a single dose administered solely for observation) constitutes medical treatment and triggers recording.

3. **Confusing OTC at prescription strength**: If a physician directs use of OTC medication at prescription strength (e.g., 800mg ibuprofen), this IS medical treatment.

4. **Counting day of injury**: The day of injury is NOT counted when calculating days away from work. Counting starts the next calendar day.

5. **Missing the 180-day cap**: Days away from work are capped at 180 days. Do not record more than 180 days even if employee remains out longer.

6. **Ignoring loss of consciousness**: Any loss of consciousness, even momentary, triggers recording regardless of other treatment.

7. **Confusing diagnostic procedures with treatment**: X-rays, MRIs, blood tests, and other diagnostic procedures are NOT medical treatment. The treatment that follows the diagnosis determines recordability.

8. **Recording observation visits**: A visit to a physician solely for observation or counseling, with no treatment provided, does not constitute medical treatment.

9. **Missing stitches/sutures**: Sutures, staples, and surgical glue are ALWAYS medical treatment, regardless of wound size.

10. **Physical therapy confusion**: Physical therapy and chiropractic treatment are ALWAYS medical treatment, even for a single session.

## FAQ

1) **Are butterfly bandages considered first aid or medical treatment?**
   Butterfly bandages and Steri-Strips are specifically listed as first aid in 29 CFR 1904.7(a). They are NOT medical treatment and do not trigger recording by themselves.

2) **If an employee receives stitches but no days away from work, is it recordable?**
   Yes. Sutures (stitches) constitute medical treatment beyond first aid. The case is recordable regardless of whether there are days away from work.

3) **Does an X-ray make a case recordable?**
   No. Diagnostic procedures such as X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, and blood tests are not considered medical treatment. Only the treatment provided after diagnosis determines recordability.

4) **If a doctor prescribes medication but the employee doesn't take it, is the case recordable?**
   The case is recordable based on the recommendation of medical treatment, not whether the employee actually takes the medication. However, if the physician recommends prescription medication solely for observation purposes (single dose), this does not trigger recording.

5) **How do I count days away if the employee was scheduled off anyway?**
   Count all calendar days the employee is unable to work, including weekends, holidays, vacation days, and any other days the employee would not normally work. The count is based on inability to work, not scheduled work days.
