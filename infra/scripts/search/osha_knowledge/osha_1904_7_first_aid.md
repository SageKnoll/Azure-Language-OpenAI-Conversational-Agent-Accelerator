# Information about regulation section: 1904.7(a)
29 CFR 1904.7(a) - First Aid Definition and List

## Authority
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)

## Category
Recording Criteria - First Aid vs Medical Treatment

## Purpose
Provides the definitive list of treatments that OSHA considers "first aid." Treatments on this list do NOT trigger OSHA recording requirements by themselves. Any treatment NOT on this list is considered "medical treatment" and DOES trigger recording if the case is work-related.

## Key Requirements
- First aid treatments do not make a case recordable
- Medical treatment (anything beyond first aid) makes a work-related case recordable
- The list of first aid treatments is exhaustive - if a treatment is not listed, it is medical treatment
- The distinction is based on the treatment itself, not the severity of the injury

## Technical Specs

### Complete First Aid List (§1904.7(a))

The following treatments are considered FIRST AID and do NOT trigger recording:

| Category | First Aid Treatment | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| **Medications** | Non-prescription medications at non-prescription strength | OTC drugs at OTC dosage only |
| **Immunizations** | Tetanus immunizations | Preventive, not treatment |
| **Wound Care** | Cleaning, flushing, or soaking wounds on skin surface | Surface wounds only |
| **Wound Coverings** | Bandages, Band-Aids, gauze pads | Basic wound protection |
| **Wound Closure** | Butterfly bandages, Steri-Strips | Non-suture closure only |
| **Therapy** | Hot or cold therapy | Ice packs, heating pads |
| **Support** | Non-rigid means of support | Elastic bandages, wraps, non-rigid back belts |
| **Transport** | Temporary immobilization devices during transport | Splints, slings, neck collars, back boards |
| **Nail/Blister** | Drilling fingernail/toenail to relieve pressure | Includes draining blisters |
| **Eye Care** | Eye patches | Covering only |
| **Eye - Foreign Body** | Removing foreign body from eye using irrigation or cotton swab | Simple removal only |
| **Splinters** | Removing splinters/foreign material by irrigation, tweezers, cotton swabs | Simple means only |
| **Finger Guards** | Using finger guards | Protective devices |
| **Massage** | Massages | Note: PT/chiropractic is NOT first aid |
| **Heat Stress** | Drinking fluids for relief of heat stress | Hydration therapy |

### What is NOT First Aid (Medical Treatment)

| Treatment | Why It's Medical Treatment |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| Prescription medications | Requires medical authority |
| Non-prescription at prescription strength | Physician-directed dosing |
| Sutures, staples, surgical glue | Wound closure beyond surface |
| Rigid supports (casts, immobilizing splints) | Beyond temporary support |
| Physical therapy | Professional treatment |
| Chiropractic treatment | Professional treatment |
| Removing foreign body from wound | Surgical procedure |
| Surgical debridement | Cutting away tissue |
| Any device with rigid stays to immobilize | Beyond temporary immobilization |

### Critical Distinctions

**Wound Closure:**
- ✅ First Aid: Butterfly bandages, Steri-Strips
- ❌ Medical Treatment: Sutures, staples, surgical glue (Dermabond)

**Medications:**
- ✅ First Aid: 200mg ibuprofen (OTC strength)
- ❌ Medical Treatment: 800mg ibuprofen (prescription strength)
- ❌ Medical Treatment: Any prescription medication

**Support Devices:**
- ✅ First Aid: Elastic bandage, ACE wrap, non-rigid back belt
- ❌ Medical Treatment: Cast, rigid splint, walking boot

**Eye Foreign Body Removal:**
- ✅ First Aid: Irrigation, cotton swab (eye surface only)
- ❌ Medical Treatment: Any instrument, any procedure, foreign body embedded

**Splinter/Foreign Body Removal:**
- ✅ First Aid: Tweezers, irrigation, cotton swab (simple removal)
- ❌ Medical Treatment: Requires incision or is complicated

**Massage vs Therapy:**
- ✅ First Aid: Massage (rubbing muscles)
- ❌ Medical Treatment: Physical therapy, chiropractic treatment

## Decision Flow

```
Was treatment provided?
├─ No treatment → NOT RECORDABLE (based on treatment)
└─ Yes → Check if treatment is on the First Aid list

Is the treatment on the First Aid list?
├─ Yes, exactly as described → FIRST AID (not recordable based on treatment alone)
└─ No, or exceeds the description → MEDICAL TREATMENT (recordable if work-related)

Note: Even first aid cases may be recordable if they involve:
- Death
- Days away from work
- Restricted work or job transfer
- Loss of consciousness
- Significant diagnosis by PLHCP
```

## Common Misapplications

1. **Assuming wound severity determines first aid vs medical**: The treatment provided determines the classification, NOT the size or severity of the wound. A small cut closed with sutures = medical treatment. A large cut covered with a bandage = first aid.

2. **Confusing butterfly bandages with sutures**: Butterfly bandages and Steri-Strips are explicitly first aid. Sutures, staples, and surgical glue (Dermabond) are always medical treatment.

3. **Misclassifying prescription-strength OTC**: If a physician directs taking OTC medication at higher than OTC dosage (e.g., "take 800mg ibuprofen 3x daily"), this is medical treatment even though the medication itself is available OTC.

4. **Counting massage as physical therapy**: Simple massage is first aid. Physical therapy, even a single session, is medical treatment - they are distinct treatments.

5. **Elastic bandage vs rigid splint**: An elastic (ACE) bandage is first aid. A rigid splint, walking boot, or cast is medical treatment. The key is whether it immobilizes the body part.

6. **Eye foreign body complexity**: Simple irrigation or cotton swab removal from the eye surface is first aid. Any other method, instrument, or embedded foreign body removal is medical treatment.

7. **Transport vs treatment immobilization**: A splint used solely during transport to a medical facility is first aid. A splint prescribed as ongoing treatment is medical treatment.

8. **Tetanus shot classification**: A tetanus immunization is first aid (preventive). It does not make a case recordable.

9. **Single dose exception misuse**: A single dose of prescription medication given solely for observation is not medical treatment. However, if the single dose is given as treatment (not observation), it IS medical treatment.

10. **Chiropractic = medical treatment**: Many employers incorrectly classify chiropractic visits as first aid. Chiropractic treatment is explicitly NOT on the first aid list and is therefore medical treatment.

## Regulatory Citation
- **Primary**: 29 CFR 1904.7(a) - General recording criteria, first aid definition
- **Guidance**: OSHA Instruction CPL 02-00-172, Chapter 7 - Recording Criteria
- **Letters of Interpretation**: Multiple OSHA LOIs address specific treatment questions

## FAQ

1) **Is Dermabond (skin glue) considered first aid?**
   No. Surgical glue/skin adhesive is explicitly listed as medical treatment in 29 CFR 1904.7(a). It is grouped with sutures and staples as a wound closing device beyond first aid.

2) **If an employee gets a tetanus shot after a cut, is the case recordable?**
   The tetanus shot itself is first aid and does not trigger recording. However, if other treatment was provided (sutures, prescription antibiotics, etc.), the case may be recordable based on that other treatment.

3) **Are elastic bandages the same as ACE wraps?**
   Yes. Elastic bandages, ACE wraps, and similar non-rigid support devices are first aid. The key characteristic is that they are non-rigid (flexible) and do not immobilize.

4) **What if an employee sees a chiropractor once and never returns?**
   Even a single chiropractic visit constitutes medical treatment. The case is recordable if work-related, regardless of whether the employee continues treatment.

5) **Can I use the first aid list to decide if someone needs to see a doctor?**
   No. The first aid list is for OSHA recording purposes only. It should not be used to make medical decisions. Always seek appropriate medical care regardless of OSHA recording implications.
