# Information about regulation section: 1904.29
29 CFR 1904.29 - Forms and Privacy Concern Cases

## Authority
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)

## Category
Forms and Privacy Requirements

## Purpose
Establishes requirements for maintaining OSHA Forms 300, 300A, and 301, and defines "privacy concern cases" where the employee's name must be withheld from the Form 300 Log to protect sensitive information.

## Key Requirements
- Use OSHA Forms 300, 300A, and 301 (or equivalent)
- Identify and protect privacy concern cases
- Enter "privacy case" instead of employee name on Form 300 for qualifying cases
- Maintain a separate confidential list linking case numbers to employee names
- Employee may request privacy for "other illnesses" if they independently request it

## Technical Specs

### Privacy Concern Cases (§1904.29(b)(6)-(7))

The following case types MUST be recorded as "privacy case" on Form 300:

| Case Type | Description | Why It's Private |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Intimate body part injury** | Injury to intimate body parts or reproductive system | Personal/sensitive |
| **Sexual assault** | Injury resulting from sexual assault | Trauma/sensitive |
| **Mental illness** | Work-related mental illness | Stigma/sensitive |
| **HIV/Hepatitis/TB** | HIV infection, hepatitis, or tuberculosis | Medical privacy |
| **Needlestick/sharps** | Needlestick or cut from sharp contaminated with blood or OPIM | Exposure privacy |
| **Employee request** | Other illness where employee independently requests privacy | Self-determination |

### How to Record Privacy Cases

**On Form 300 (Log):**
- Column A (Case No.): Enter the case number as usual
- Column B (Employee Name): Enter **"Privacy Case"** instead of name
- All other columns: Complete normally

**On Form 301 (Incident Report):**
- Complete the form fully including employee name
- Keep Form 301 in a separate, confidential location
- Do not post or share Form 301 for privacy cases

**Confidential List:**
- Maintain a separate list linking case numbers to employee names
- Keep this list confidential and secure
- Use for internal tracking and OSHA requests only

### What "Intimate Body Parts" Means

OSHA considers these intimate body parts:
- Genitals
- Groin
- Breast
- Buttocks
- Reproductive organs

Injuries to these areas are automatically privacy concern cases.

### Mental Illness Recording

Mental illnesses are privacy concern cases, but they ARE still recordable if:
- The illness is work-related
- It meets general recording criteria (days away, treatment, etc.)
- There is objective evidence of work-relatedness

Record as "privacy case" on Form 300, but still count in summary totals.

### Employee-Requested Privacy

For illnesses NOT automatically covered, an employee may request privacy if:
- The employee **independently** and **voluntarily** requests it
- The employer does not ask or suggest the employee request privacy
- The request is documented

This does NOT apply to injuries - only to "other illnesses."

### Forms Overview

| Form | Purpose | Privacy Handling |
|------|---------|------------------|
| **Form 300** | Log of injuries/illnesses | "Privacy Case" in name column |
| **Form 300A** | Annual summary | No individual names (aggregate only) |
| **Form 301** | Individual incident report | Complete fully, keep confidential |

### Equivalent Forms

Employers may use equivalent forms if they contain the same information:
- Workers' compensation forms may substitute for Form 301
- State forms may substitute if they contain required data elements
- Private forms acceptable if all required fields present

## Decision Flow

```
Is this a new recordable case?
├─ No → No form entry needed
└─ Yes → Determine if privacy concern case

Is it a privacy concern case?
├─ Intimate body part injury? → YES, privacy case
├─ Sexual assault injury? → YES, privacy case
├─ Mental illness? → YES, privacy case
├─ HIV, hepatitis, or TB? → YES, privacy case
├─ Needlestick/sharps with blood/OPIM? → YES, privacy case
├─ Employee independently requested privacy? → YES, privacy case
└─ None of the above → NO, use employee name

If privacy case:
├─ Form 300: Enter "Privacy Case" in Column B
├─ Form 301: Complete fully, keep confidential
└─ Maintain confidential list linking case # to name
```

## Common Misapplications

1. **Asking employees if they want privacy**: Employers should NOT ask employees if they want their case kept private. Privacy requests must be **independently initiated** by the employee. Asking creates pressure and is not compliant.

2. **Assuming all needlesticks are privacy cases**: Only needlesticks involving blood or Other Potentially Infectious Materials (OPIM) are automatic privacy cases. A clean needlestick (no blood/OPIM) is not automatically a privacy case.

3. **Not recording mental illness at all**: Mental illness IS recordable if work-related and meeting criteria. It's a privacy case (use "privacy case" on Form 300), but it must still be recorded and counted.

4. **Omitting privacy cases from Form 300A totals**: Privacy cases are still counted in the annual summary totals. Only the name is protected, not the case itself.

5. **Keeping all Form 301s with Form 300**: Form 301s for privacy cases should be stored separately and securely, not in the same location as the Form 300 Log.

6. **Using "privacy case" for all injuries**: Only the specific categories listed qualify. A broken arm, laceration, or strain is NOT a privacy case unless it involves intimate body parts.

7. **Allowing supervisor requests for privacy**: Only the injured/ill employee can request privacy. A supervisor or HR cannot request privacy on behalf of an employee.

8. **Not maintaining the confidential link**: You must maintain a way to link "privacy case" entries to actual employee names for OSHA requests and internal tracking.

9. **Extending privacy to Form 300A**: Form 300A is a summary with no individual names regardless. Privacy concern case procedures only affect Form 300 and Form 301 handling.

10. **Forgetting privacy case for sexual assault**: Sexual assault injuries are always privacy cases. This is sometimes overlooked in workplace violence incidents.

## FAQ

1) **Can I use "Anonymous" instead of "Privacy Case" on Form 300?**
   OSHA specifies entering "privacy case" in the employee name field. Using "Anonymous," initials, or other identifiers is not compliant with the regulation's specific language.

2) **If an employee has HIV and gets a paper cut at work, is it a privacy case?**
   The paper cut itself is not a privacy case. However, if the employee's HIV status would be revealed by recording the case (e.g., if treatment involves HIV-related care), consider whether privacy protections apply. The HIV condition itself, if work-related and recordable, would be a privacy case.

3) **Do privacy cases count toward our injury rates (TCIR, DART)?**
   Yes. Privacy cases are fully counted in all calculations. Only the employee's name is protected, not the existence of the case.

4) **An employee asked their supervisor to keep their injury private. Is that valid?**
   Only if the employee initiated the request without prompting, AND it's an illness (not an injury), AND it falls under "other illnesses." Supervisors should not ask or suggest privacy, and injuries are not eligible for employee-requested privacy.

5) **Where should I store Form 301s for privacy cases?**
   Separately from the regular Form 300 Log and other Form 301s. Use a locked file, secure digital folder, or other confidential storage with limited access.
