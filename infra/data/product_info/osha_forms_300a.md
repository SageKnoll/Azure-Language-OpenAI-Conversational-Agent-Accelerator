## Technical Specs

### Timeline Requirements

| Date | Action Required |
|------|-----------------|
| January 1 - 31 | Prepare Form 300A, calculate totals, gather certification |
| **February 1** | **BEGIN posting Form 300A** |
| February 1 - April 30 | Form 300A must remain posted |
| **April 30** | Last day Form 300A must be posted |
| May 1 | May remove Form 300A (but retain for 5 years) |

### Form 300A Contents

The Annual Summary must include:
- Calendar year covered
- Company name and establishment information
- Total number of deaths
- Total number of cases with days away from work
- Total number of cases with job transfer or restriction
- Total number of other recordable cases
- Total number of days away from work
- Total number of days of job transfer or restriction
- Injury and illness types (columns)
- Establishment information (average annual employees, total hours worked)
- Certification signature and date

### Certification Requirements (§1904.32(b)(3))

A company executive must certify the annual summary. Authorized certifiers include:
- Owner of the company (if sole proprietorship or partnership)
- Officer of the corporation
- Highest ranking company official working at the establishment
- Immediate supervisor of the highest ranking company official at the establishment

The certification states:
> "I certify that I have examined this document and that to the best of my knowledge the entries are true, accurate, and complete."

### Posting Requirements (§1904.32(b)(5))

- Post in **conspicuous place(s)** where notices to employees are customarily posted
- If establishment has multiple locations where notices are posted, post at each location
- Ensure employees can observe the posted summary
- Do not alter, deface, or cover the summary during the posting period
- The form must be posted even if there were **zero recordable cases**

### Zero Injury Summary

If there were no recordable injuries or illnesses during the year:
- Still prepare Form 300A
- Enter zeros in all category fields
- Still requires executive certification
- Still must be posted February 1 through April 30

### Calculating Average Employment (§1904.32(b)(2))

To calculate average number of employees:
1. Add total number of employees paid during all pay periods in the year
2. Count both full-time and part-time workers
3. Count seasonal and temporary workers
4. Divide by number of pay periods during the year

Example:
- Biweekly payroll (26 pay periods)
- Total employees across all pay periods: 2,600
- Average employment: 2,600 ÷ 26 = 100 employees

### Calculating Total Hours Worked

Include hours worked by:
- Salaried employees (estimate or use standard 40 hrs/week × weeks worked)
- Hourly employees (actual hours from payroll)
- Part-time workers
- Seasonal and temporary workers

Do NOT include:
- Vacation hours
- Sick leave hours
- Holiday hours (not worked)
- Other non-work time

## Decision Flow

```
Is it February 1 or later?
├─ No → Prepare Form 300A, have executive certify
└─ Yes → Post immediately if not already posted

Is Form 300A currently posted?
├─ No → Post in conspicuous location(s) immediately
└─ Yes → Verify it remains posted through April 30

Is today after April 30?
├─ No → Keep Form 300A posted
└─ Yes → May remove (retain copy for 5 years)
```

## Common Misapplications

1. **Missing the February 1 posting date**: The most common violation. Form 300A must be posted starting February 1, not "sometime in February."

2. **Removing before April 30**: The form must remain posted through April 30. Removing it early, even by one day, is a violation.

3. **Not posting with zero injuries**: A summary is required even if there were no recordable injuries or illnesses. Many employers incorrectly skip posting when there's "nothing to report."

4. **Wrong person certifying**: The certification must be signed by a company executive (owner, officer, or highest-ranking official). A safety manager, HR manager, or supervisor is NOT sufficient unless they are the highest-ranking official at that establishment.

5. **Posting in non-conspicuous location**: The form must be posted where employees can see it - typically near time clocks, break rooms, or bulletin boards. Posting in a locked office or HR file does not comply.

6. **Using wrong year's form**: Ensure you're using the Form 300A for the correct year. The form references the calendar year being summarized.

7. **Incorrect hours worked calculation**: Hours worked means actual hours worked, not hours paid. Exclude vacation, sick time, and holidays.

8. **Missing multiple posting locations**: If the establishment has multiple areas where notices are customarily posted (multiple break rooms, multiple buildings), the summary should be posted at each location.

9. **Failing to retain for 5 years**: Form 300A must be retained for 5 years following the year it covers. 2024's summary must be kept until December 31, 2029.

10. **Not updating for late-discovered cases**: If you discover a recordable case after preparing the summary but before posting ends, you must update Form 300A.

## FAQ

1) **What if we had zero recordable injuries? Do we still post Form 300A?**
   Yes. You must prepare, certify, and post Form 300A even if all entries are zero. The form shows employees that you are tracking workplace safety.

2) **Can our Safety Manager sign the certification?**
   Only if the Safety Manager is the highest-ranking company official at the establishment. Otherwise, an owner, corporate officer, or higher-ranking official must sign.

3) **Do we need to post Form 300A at each job site?**
   Post where notices are customarily posted for that establishment's employees. For construction companies with multiple job sites, this typically means posting at the main office or wherever workers report. Consult OSHA guidance for multi-site situations.

4) **What happens if we discover a recordable case in February that occurred last year?**
   Update the Form 300 Log and the Form 300A summary. The posted 300A should reflect all recordable cases, even those discovered late.

5) **How long must we keep Form 300A on file?**
   Five years following the end of the calendar year the form covers. The 2024 summary must be retained until December 31, 2029.
