# Information about regulation section: 1904.5
29 CFR 1904.5 - Determination of Work-Relatedness

## Authority
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)

## Category
Recording Criteria - Work-Relatedness

## Purpose
Establishes the criteria for determining whether an injury or illness is work-related for OSHA recordkeeping purposes. Work-relatedness is presumed for injuries occurring in the work environment unless a specific exception applies.

## Key Requirements
- An injury or illness is work-related if an event or exposure in the work environment caused or contributed to the condition, OR significantly aggravated a pre-existing condition
- Work-relatedness is presumed for injuries/illnesses in the work environment
- The presumption can be rebutted only if a specific exception in §1904.5(b)(2) applies
- "Work environment" includes the establishment and other locations where employees work or are present as a condition of employment

## Technical Specs

### The Work-Relatedness Standard (§1904.5(a))

An injury or illness is work-related if **any** of the following occurred in the work environment:
- An event caused or contributed to the injury/illness
- An exposure caused or contributed to the injury/illness
- An event or exposure significantly aggravated a pre-existing condition

**"Significantly aggravated"** means:
- A pre-existing injury/illness is made **permanently worse**, OR
- Results in treatment that would not have been needed but for the workplace event/exposure

### The Work Environment (§1904.5(b)(1))

The work environment includes:
- The employer's establishment (primary workplace)
- Other locations where employees are present as a condition of employment
- Company parking lots and access roads
- Remote work locations if working
- Travel status locations (with exceptions below)

### Exceptions - When Work-Relatedness Does NOT Apply (§1904.5(b)(2))

| Exception | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Public location** | Present as member of general public, not working | Stopping at store on way home |
| **Symptoms only** | Symptoms surface at work but caused entirely by non-work event | Cold symptoms appear at work |
| **Voluntary participation** | Voluntary wellness/fitness program, recreational activity | Company softball game injury |
| **Personal food** | Eating, drinking, or preparing personal food | Choking on personal lunch |
| **Personal tasks** | Personal tasks outside assigned hours | Staying late for personal errands |
| **Personal grooming** | Self-inflicted during grooming, self-medication | Cut while shaving at work |
| **Motor vehicle accident** | On company parking lot during commute | Fender bender while parking |
| **Common cold/flu** | Cold or flu (not including pandemic flu) | Catching cold from coworker |
| **Mental illness** | Mental illness (unless specific exception) | See mental illness criteria |

### Geographic Presumption

**At the establishment**: Work-relatedness is presumed. Employer must prove exception applies.

**Away from establishment**: 
- Employee must be present as condition of employment
- Work-relatedness still presumed during work activities
- Not work-related if acting as member of general public

### Travel Status (§1904.5(b)(6))

**Work-related during travel:**
- Performing work duties
- Activities incidental to work travel (eating, sleeping, travel between work and lodging)
- Travel between work sites

**NOT work-related during travel:**
- Personal detours for non-work reasons
- Deviation from reasonably direct travel route for personal reasons
- Activities that are clearly personal (entertainment with friends, tourism)

### Pre-existing Conditions (§1904.5(a))

A work event that **significantly aggravates** a pre-existing condition IS work-related if it results in:
- Death (when otherwise would not have died)
- Loss of consciousness (when otherwise would not have)
- Days away, restriction, transfer (when otherwise would not have)
- Medical treatment (when otherwise would not have)
- Significant diagnosis (when otherwise would not have been made)

If work made the condition temporarily worse but required NO additional treatment beyond what was already occurring, it is NOT work-related.

### Work at Home (§1904.5(b)(7))

Injuries at home ARE work-related if:
- Injury occurred while performing work for pay
- Injury is directly related to work performance
- Injury occurred in work area (designated home office)

Injuries at home are NOT work-related if:
- General home hazards (slip in kitchen getting coffee)
- Not in designated work area
- Not performing work duties

## Decision Flow

```
Step 1: Did injury/illness occur in the work environment?
        ├─ No → NOT WORK-RELATED
        └─ Yes → Presumed work-related, continue to Step 2

Step 2: Does a specific exception apply?
        ├─ Public location? → NOT WORK-RELATED
        ├─ Symptoms only surfaced at work? → NOT WORK-RELATED
        ├─ Voluntary recreation/wellness? → NOT WORK-RELATED
        ├─ Personal food preparation/consumption? → NOT WORK-RELATED
        ├─ Personal tasks outside work hours? → NOT WORK-RELATED
        ├─ Personal grooming/self-medication? → NOT WORK-RELATED
        ├─ Motor vehicle accident during commute? → NOT WORK-RELATED
        ├─ Common cold/flu? → NOT WORK-RELATED
        └─ No exception applies → WORK-RELATED

Step 3: If pre-existing condition, was it significantly aggravated?
        ├─ Yes (permanent worsening OR new treatment required) → WORK-RELATED
        └─ No (temporary flare-up, no new treatment) → NOT WORK-RELATED
```

## Common Misapplications

1. **Requiring proof of causation**: Employers often try to prove the injury *wasn't* caused by work. The standard is whether work **contributed** to the injury, not sole causation. If work contributed, it's work-related.

2. **Using the "idiopathic" exclusion incorrectly**: There is no blanket exclusion for idiopathic (unknown cause) injuries. If an employee faints and falls at work, the fall injuries are work-related even if the fainting cause is unknown.

3. **Excluding parking lot injuries**: Injuries on company parking lots are generally work-related UNLESS the employee is in a motor vehicle commuting to/from work. Slipping on ice while walking across the lot IS work-related.

4. **Pre-existing condition confusion**: A pre-existing back condition that flares up at work is only work-related if work **significantly aggravated** it. A temporary increase in symptoms is not significant aggravation.

5. **Personal food exception misuse**: The exception for food only applies to **personal** food brought from home or purchased at a restaurant. Food provided by the employer (catered lunch, vending machine on premises) does not qualify for this exception.

6. **Voluntary recreation interpretation**: Company-sponsored events are not automatically excluded. If participation is expected, encouraged by management, or occurs during work hours with pay, it may not qualify as "voluntary."

7. **Travel status determination**: Being in travel status does not make every injury work-related. Personal activities during travel (sightseeing, visiting friends, personal errands) are not work-related.

8. **Working from home assumptions**: Not all injuries at home are automatically work-related. The injury must occur while performing work, in a designated work area, and be related to work activities.

9. **Mental illness exception**: Mental illness is generally excluded, but work-related mental illness IS recordable if you have objective evidence of work-relatedness (stress from traumatic work event, for example).

10. **Cold/flu vs pandemic flu**: Common cold and seasonal flu are excluded. Pandemic flu and COVID-19 may be work-related if contracted through work exposure - this exception does not apply to pandemic situations.

## FAQ

1) **If an employee has a heart attack at work, is it work-related?**
   Generally yes, because it occurred in the work environment and no specific exception applies. However, if the heart attack was solely caused by a pre-existing heart condition with no work contribution, it may not be work-related. This is a complex determination.

2) **Is an injury during a company picnic work-related?**
   It depends on whether participation was truly voluntary. If attendance was expected, during work hours, or strongly encouraged by management, injuries may be work-related. If truly voluntary and outside work hours, the exception likely applies.

3) **An employee slips on ice in our parking lot. Work-related?**
   Yes, unless they were in a motor vehicle at the time of the incident. Walking across the parking lot to enter/exit the building is considered part of the work environment.

4) **Employee's pre-existing bad back "went out" while lifting at work. Recordable?**
   Only if the work event significantly aggravated the condition - meaning it was permanently worsened OR required treatment that would not otherwise have been needed. A temporary flare-up that resolves without additional treatment is not work-related.

5) **Our employee got COVID-19. Is it work-related?**
   The common cold/flu exception does not apply to COVID-19 in most interpretations. COVID-19 may be work-related if there is evidence of workplace exposure. Evaluate each case individually based on likelihood of work vs. community exposure.
